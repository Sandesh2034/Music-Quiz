# Sandesh Gurung's Frontend Web Developer Bootcamp Assignment - Module 6 Challenge

## Code Quiz

### Overview

Hey there! Welcome to my Module 6 Challenge as part of the Frontend Web Developer Bootcamp. In this assignment, I'm excited to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This is a fantastic opportunity for me to get a taste of the coding assessments I might encounter in future job interviews.

### Task Description

My goal is to create a web application that runs in the browser, featuring dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. I want my quiz to have a sleek, polished, and responsive user interface. Here are the main functionalities I'm aiming for:

1. **Start Button:**
   - Clicking this button will kickstart the quiz, begin the timer, and show the first question.

2. **Questions:**
   - Each question will have multiple-choice answers as buttons.
   - Choosing an answer should smoothly transition to the next question.
   - If I pick an incorrect answer, I want to see time deducted from the timer.

3. **Timer:**
   - I expect the timer to count down during the quiz.
   - The quiz should wrap up when I've answered all the questions or when the timer hits 0.

4. **End of Quiz:**
   - At the end of the game, I want to see my score.
   - I should be able to save my initials and score for future reference.

### User Story

**AS A** coding boot camp student  
**I WANT** to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores  
**SO THAT** I can measure my progress compared to my peers

### Acceptance Criteria

Here's what I'm looking to achieve:

- A start button that kicks off the quiz, starts the timer, and displays the first question.
- Questions with buttons for each answer.
- Progressing to the next question when I select an answer.
- Deducting time from the clock for incorrect answers.
- The quiz concluding when I've answered all questions or the timer reaches 0.
- Displaying my score at the end of the quiz.
- Allowing me to save my initials and score.

### Implementation

I'll be applying the skills covered in this week's coursework to get this done. HTML for structuring, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic functionality. I'll be focusing on creating a responsive and user-friendly interface.
